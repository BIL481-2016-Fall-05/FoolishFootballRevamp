Installing
==========

Foolish Football is in *alpha* status and users will likely have to be technically savvy enough to compile and run the application. Ideally we'd like to see patches accompanying bug reports in the issue tracker.

A prerequisite is a copy of the file named `Sensible World of Soccer 96-97 (1996)(Sensible Software).zip` (md5 `87f967b9f04a03ff6cfbc1a1ff97cbef`) or similar, which should be extracted into the folder referenced in the `Main` class.

SBT is the build tool and plugins exist for all popular IDEs. `sbt run` should be enough to start the main application, `ESC` to get out.

**If you don't understand these instructions, it is highly likely that you are *not* a suitable *alpha* tester – please come back when the application is in *beta*.**
